# Typography

The **typography** folder contains most elements related to displaying text. From headers and paragraphs, to code blocks and lists.

## Headers

The **headers.scss** file sets headers 1 through 6 with default styling. Making sure the headers act as a waterfall, where `<h1>` is the largest, and `<h6>` the smallest.

## Inline

The **inline.scss** file sets some inline elements used in, for example, paragraphs. Elements like `<strong>` and `<em>`.

## Lists

The **lists.scss** file makes sure the list types are acting like proper lists again after our previous **reset.scss** and **normalize.scss**.

## Links

The **links.scss** file adds styling to anchors. Mostly staying with its default browser behavior, but more importantly, setting the colors. It uses the colors **primary**, **secondary** and **tertiary** supplied by **base/variables.scss**.

## Blocks

The **blocks.scss** file contains styling for some block like elements, like the `<blockquote>` and `<code>` blocks.
